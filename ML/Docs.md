Should I try to build AI/ML Microservices or just try to integrate into one big API?

This is a design question that IDK

API Gateway as a reverse proxy to different APIS?

api.clairvoyancesystems.com/api/ML -> points to localhost:8001
api.clairvoyancesystems.com/api/events -> points to localhost:8000
