Cool now I'm in my desktop computer from my web app running on my laptop.

Basically just need to improve the UI, add a few more functions, and then get security down %150 and then I can create a cloud storage service to market. I also need to understand NGINX.

I'm thinking of just opening 80, and 443 on the network if I can and then making sure everything is secure from there.
